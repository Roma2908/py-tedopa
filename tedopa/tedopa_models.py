"""
This module contains functions which enable the user to run TEDOPA for
certain settings without having to know ``mpnum``. This is a wrapper for the
tedopa/tedopa.py module.

TEDOPA proceeds in two steps: (i) Map the Hamiltonian from a system,
composed of one or two sites that are each linearly coupled to a
distinct reservoir of bosonic modes with a given spectral function, to the same
site/sites coupled to a 1D chain of oscillators (one chain per system site) and
(ii) perform time evolution.

The performed mapping is based on an algorithm introduced by Chin et al. in
Journal of Mathematical Physics 51, 092109 (2010); doi: 10.1063/1.3490188.

If something is unclear in the functions here, please look at
tedopa/tedopa.py or of course the example notebooks for deeper understanding.
