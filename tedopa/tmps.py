"""
This module provides functions for time evolution of a state given as MPS,
MPO or PMPS via the tMPS algorithm.

This is based on functions which calculate the time evolution of an operator in
MPS, MPO or PMPS form from Hamiltonians acting on every single and every two
adjacent sites.

tMPS is a method to evolve a one dimensional quantum state, represented
as an MPS, MPO or PMPS, in time. It requires that the Hamiltonian is only
comprised of terms acting on single sites or pairs of adjacent sites of
the state. This allows the Hamiltonian :math:`H` to be written as

.. math::
    H = \\sum_j h_{j, j+1},

where :math:`j` is the index of the respective site in the state.
These components can be grouped into those acting on even and those acting
on odd sites, leading to a time evolution operator

.. math::
    U(\\tau) = \\text{e}^{\mathrm{i}(H_{\\text{even}}+H_{\\text{
    odd}})\\tau},

with

.. math::
    H_{\\text{even}} = \\sum_{j\\text{ even}} h_{j, j+1}
.. math::
    H_{\\text{odd}} = \\sum_{j\\text{ odd}} h_{j, j+1}

This allows to perform Trotter-Suzuki decompositions of :math:`U`,
for example of second order:

.. math::
    U(\\tau) = \\text{e}^{\mathrm{i} H_{\\text{odd}} \\tau/2} \\text{e}^{\mathrm{i}
    H_{\\text{even}} \\tau} \\text{e}^{\mathrm{i} H_{\\text{odd}} \\tau/2}
    + \\mathcal{O}(\\tau^3).

These decompositions provide the advantage that :math:`U` does not need to
be calculated as a whole matrix, which could potentially become way too
big. Since the elements within :math:`H_{\\text{even}}` and those within
:math:`H_{\\text{odd}}` commute, :math:`U` can be broken up into smaller pieces
which a computer can handle even for very large systems.

For more information, see chapter 7 in Schollwöck’s paper Annals of
Physics 326, 96-192 (2011); doi: 10.1016/j.aop.2010.09.012

In this file, :func:`evolve` is the main function to be called to evolve a
state in time. It will itself call :func:`_trotter_slice` which will call
:func:`_trotter_two` or :func:`_trotter_four` to calculate the :math:`U(
\\tau)` representing one Trotter slice. When that is done, :func:`evolve`
will take it and pass it on to :func:`_time_evolution` which will then go
through the Trotter iterations, thus actually evolving the state in time,
and store the requested results on the way.

    The initial state, Hamiltonians and certain parameters are required. The

    Args:
        state (mpnum.MPArray):

        hamiltonians (list):
            Either a list containing the Hamiltonian acting on every single site
            and the Hamiltonian acting on every two adjacents sites, like
            ``[H_i, H_ij]``, or a list containing a list of Hamiltonians acting

            adjacent sites, like ``[[h1, h2, h3, ...], [h12, h23, h34, ...]]``
        num_trotter_slices (int):
            Number of Trotter slices to be used for evolution over time equal to
            the largest t in ts.
        method (str):
            Which method to use. Either 'mps', 'mpo' or 'pmps'.
        trotter_order (int):
            Order of Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to be used. Currently only 2
            and 4 are implemented
        ts (list[float]):
            The times for which the evolution should be computed and the state
            of the full system or a subsystem returned (i.e. it's reduced
            density matrix). The algorithm will calculate the
            evolution using the given number of Trotter steps for the largest
            number in ts. On the way there it will store the evolved states for
            smaller times. NB: Beware of memory overload since len(t) number of
            mpnum.MPArrays will be stored
        trotter_compr (dict):
            Compression parameters used in the iterations of Trotter (in the
            form required by :func:`mpnum.MPArray.compress`. If unsure, look at
            https://github.com/dseuss/mpnum/blob/master/examples/mpnum_intro.ipynb .)
            If omitted, some default compression will be used that will
            probably work but might lead to problems. See
            :func:`_set_compr_params` for more information.
        compr (dict):
            Parameters for the compression which is executed on every MPA during
            the calculations, except for the Trotter calculation, where
            trotter_compr is used. compr = dict(method='svd', rank=10) would for
            example ensure that the ranks of any MPA never exceed 10 during all
            of the calculations. An accepted relative error for the
            compression can be provided in addition to or instead of ranks,
            which would lead to e.g.
            compr = dict(method='svd', rank=10, relerr=1e-12).
            If omitted, some default compression will be used that will
            probably work but might lead to problems. See
            :func:`_set_compr_params` for more information.
        subsystems (list):
            A list defining for which subsystem the reduced density matrix or
            whether the full state should be returned for a time in ``ts``.
            This can be a list of the length same as that of ``ts`` looking
            like ``[[a1, b1], [a2, b2], ...]`` or just a list like ``[a, b]``.
            In the first case the respective subsystem for every entry in ts
            will be returned, in the second case the same subsystem will be
            returned for all entries in ``ts``. ``[a, b]`` will lead to a
            return of the reduced density matrix of the sites from ``a`` up to,
            but not including, ``b``. For example ``[0, 3]`` if the reduced
            density matrix of the first three sites should be returned. A time
            can occur twice in ``ts`` and then different subsystems to be
            returned can be defined for that same time. If this parameter is
            omitted, the full system will be returned for every time in ``ts``.
        v (int):
            Level of verbose output. 0 means no output, 1 means that some
            basic output showing the progress of calculations is produced. 2
            will in addition show the bond dimensions of the state after every
            couple of iterations, 3 will show bond dimensions after every
            Trotter iteration.

    Returns:
        list[list[float], list[list[int]], list[mpnum.MPArray]]:
            A list with five items: (i) The list of times for which the density
            matrices have been computed (ii) The list indicating which
            subsystems of the system are returned at the respective time of the
            first list (iii) The list of density matrices as MPO or PMPS as
            mpnum.MPArray, depending on the input "method". If that was MPS, the
            full states will still be MPSs, the reduced ones will be MPOs.
